## Skillshare Downloader
A Python script to download Skillshare videos from a course by simply providing the course link.

## Requirements
To use this script, you need to have Python 3.x installed on your system. You can download the latest version of Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

## Usage
```bash
  python skillshare_downloader.py

```

You will be prompted to enter the Skillshare course link. Enter the link and press enter.

The script will fetch the course information from the Skillshare API, create a directory with the course name, and download all the videos from the course into the directory.
